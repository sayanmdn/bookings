```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Pages

- **Home (`/`)** - Dashboard with upload functionality and statistics
- **Advance Pending (`/advance-pending`)** - View bookings awaiting advance payment
- **All Bookings (`/bookings`)** - Complete list of all bookings

## Excel File Format

Your Excel file should have these columns:
