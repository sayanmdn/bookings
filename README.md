NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# NextAuth Configuration
AUTH_SECRET=generate-using-openssl-rand-base64-32

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**üîê For Google SSO Setup:** See [GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Pages

- **Home (`/`)** - Dashboard with upload functionality and statistics
- **Advance Pending (`/advance-pending`)** - View bookings awaiting advance payment
- **All Bookings (`/bookings`)** - Complete list of all bookings

## Excel File Format

Your Excel file should have these columns:

- Booked by
- Guest name(s)

   - Adds new bookings
   - Preserves advance payment status
3. **Manage Advances** - Mark bookings as received on the "Advance Pending" page
4. **View All Data** - Check all bookings with their advance payment status

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub (make sure `.env.local` is not committed)

2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your repository

3. Add the following environment variables in Vercel's project settings:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` - Set to `1`
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - Generate using `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - From Google Cloud Console
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - From Google Cloud Console

4. Deploy! Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

5. **Important:** After deployment, update your Google OAuth redirect URIs with your Vercel URL

### Environment Variables Required:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string (required)
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` - Set to `1` to disable telemetry
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for NextAuth (required)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth Client ID (required)

The app will now build successfully on Vercel without hanging on telemetry prompts.
